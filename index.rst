Welcome to Coding with Dogs's documentation!
============================================
Coding with dogs can be a *great*
way to not only teach them some skills
that will help them with their
own lives, but also *create or
strengthen* some lasting
**bonds between you and them.**

Here is some new content from VS Code.

Here is a **shiny** new note.

Throughout your journey you will
both likely learn new ``concepts`` and
``terms`` that will expand your horrizons and
provide hours of enjoyment.

.. note:: 
   Some dogs have problems with screen time
   and if you leave them unattended with a
   screen and they have access to things
   like YouTube or games, they may not stay
   focused on the tastk at hand.

There are lots of great options for 
where to start,  
and :doc:`/Options/justlogic` is a great 
place to start. Note that 
the :doc:`best starting point </Options/justlogic>` is 
another way to refer to the same place 
but give your link text some title.

For details the hardware code options,
see :ref:`Options section for hardware and code <hwcodeOptions>` .
